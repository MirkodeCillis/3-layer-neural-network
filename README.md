# 3-Layer Neural Network

Simple neural network with a fixed size of three layers.
Written following the guide 'Make your own neural network' by Tariq Rashid.
I've just added a gui to let the user write a number and try it,
in addition to the use of mninst datasets.

Link to [Rashid's GitHub project](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork).

The packages I've installed to execute the program are listed in [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt).
